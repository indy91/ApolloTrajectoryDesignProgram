A tool to generate Translunar Injection (TLI) targeting data for Project Apollo - NASSP.

Installation:

Optional: To get the various output plots by the LV targeting, install Gnuplot and make sure it has been added to the PATH system variable.

Instructions:

Init page. On the init page can a project file be saved and loaded.

Lighting page. For a first evaluation of the lighting conditions at a desired landing site, the coordinates can be checked, together with a date of landing, to see if a landing is feasible on a given date.
The ideal lighting conditions vary from 5° to 20°. For some landing sites, with high nearby terrain, a higher elevation might be required. After a calculation on this page the coordinates are automatically transferred to the first guess tab.
An estimate for the day of launch is also transferred.

First guess page. The primary purpose of this page is to select the launch day. An analytic first guess logic is run to determine an estimate for time of launch, time of pericynthion passage with near free return conditions, as well as the
sun elevation angle a few orbits after perincythion. The resulting values from this page are not very accurate yet, but should be close enough to determine if the lighting at the landing site would support a launch on this day. If not the
day of launch can be adjusted and another day can be tried. After each calculation on this page, the day of launch is transferred to the mission planning page.
